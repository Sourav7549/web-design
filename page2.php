                        Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a type of talk therapy (psychotherapy). It’s based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it’s specially adapted for people who experience emotions very intensely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    “Dialectical” means combining opposite ideas. DBT focuses on helping people accept the reality of their lives and their behaviors, as well as helping them learn to change their lives, including their unhelpful behaviors.

                    Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a structured program of psychotherapy with a strong educational component designed to provide skills for managing intense emotions and negotiating social relationships. Originally developed to curb the self-destructive impulses of chronic suicidal patients, it is also the treatment of choice for borderline personality disorder, emotion dysregulation, and a growing array of psychiatric conditions.

                <b><h3>What Are the 4 Stages of DBT?</h3></b>
                <br style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <p>Dialectical behavior therapy is also divided into four stages of treatment:</p>
                
                <br/>
                    <b><li>Stage 1:</b> During the beginning of treatment, the most serious and self-destructive behaviors are the first things addressed. This may include issues such as self-injury or suicidal behaviors.</li><br/>
                   
                    <b><li>Stage 2:</b> Next, treatment moves on to address issues that affect a person's quality of life, such as their interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation skills, and ability to tolerate distress.</li>

                    <b><li>Stage 3:</b> The next step is to focus on issues related to self-esteem and interpersonal relationships.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <b><li>Stage 4:</b>At this point, treatment is focused on helping people get the most out of their lives, including finding ways to experience greater happiness, strengthen their relationships, and pursue their life goals.</li>
